            <p>To be honest, I don't have any experience in development skills and due to this reason, I join an online code bootcamp  
                <br />
                for 6 months to develop a new skills in this field. I could show you my assigments given by mentors throughout this bootcamp.
                <br />
                Furthermore, I could also show the project given by my mentor at the end of the bootcamp.</p>
